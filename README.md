# ðŸ“§ Email Sender in Python

This repository contains the source code for my **Email Sender** project â€” a simple Python script that sends emails using SMTP. The application functions like the Gmail app in terms of core functionality but operates entirely via the terminal without a graphical user interface.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Send emails using your Gmail account (or any SMTP-enabled provider)
- Add a subject and custom message body
- Send to single or multiple recipients
- Secure login using `smtplib` and `ssl`
- Easily customizable and well-documented code

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- An email account with SMTP enabled (e.g., Gmail)

> **Note:** If you're using Gmail, make sure to enable "App Passwords" or allow less secure apps (not recommended for production).

### ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-sender-python.git
   cd email-sender-python
